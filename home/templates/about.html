                <h6>TreeBooks is a small charity founded in October 2018 and our mission is to raise money to help
                    reforest
                    our planet.</h6>

                <h4>How we do it?</h4>

                <p>We collect second hand books that people donate and then we rent them for a small fee in order to
                    raise
                    money.
                    The money collected is then used to help in <a href="{% url 'projects' %}">reforestation
                        projects</a>.
                </p>


                <h4>Colaborate becoming a member!</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>By becoming a member and reading second hand books you are reducing the number of trees that are
                        cut to create new
                        books.
                    </li>

                    <li>Our books are much cheaper than brand new books and the money you pay is used for a good cause.
                    </li>

                    <li>You can also <a href="{% url 'donate' %}">donate</a> your second hand books to help us
                        growing the collection of books so we can offer more choice to our members. <a
                            href="{% url 'donate' %}">(See our
                            collection points)</a></li>
                </ul>
                <h4>More benefits for our members...</h4>
                <ul>

                    <li>You can join the waiting list for books that are not available and you will be able

                <h4>How it works?</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>As a member you can rent our books for the the number of days that you want. And the final rent
                        price will be based on the number of days selected.</li>
                    <li>Once the payment is done you can come to collect the books to our shop or we can organise a
                        delivery (for an additional fee).</li>
                    <li>The minimun time that we rent the books for is 10 days (but you can always return it earlier
                        if you want).</li>
                    <li>We know you will retun the book when it is due but we need to keep a Â£5 deposit per book just in
                        case the book is not returned. The deposit will be rufunded once the book is
                        returned.</li>
