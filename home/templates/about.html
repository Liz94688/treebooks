            <h6>TreeBooks is a small charity founded in October 2018 and our mission is to raise money to help reforest
                our planet.</h6>

            <h4>How we do it?</h4>

            <p>We collect second hand books that people donate and then we rent them for a small fee in order to raise
                money.
                The money collected is then used to help in <a href="{% url 'projects' %}">reforestation projects</a>.
            </p>


            <h4>How can you collaborate?</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>By reading second hand books you are reducing the number of trees that are cut to create new books.
                </li>

                <li>By paying us to rent a book instead of buying a brand new book you are contributing to reforest the
                    planet.</li>

                <li>You can also <a href="{% url 'donate' %}">donate</a> your second hand books to help us growing the
                    collection and offer more choice to our members. (See our collection points)</li>

                <li>Spread the word and help us get more members. More member reading our books means less trees being
                    cut.</li>
            </ul>
