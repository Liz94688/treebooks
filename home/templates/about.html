                <h6>TreeBooks is a small charity founded in October 2018 and our mission is to raise money to help
                    reforest
                    our planet.</h6>

                <h4>How we do it?</h4>

                <p>We collect second hand books that people donate and then we rent them for a small fee in order to
                    raise
                    money.
                    The money collected is then used to help in <a href="{% url 'projects' %}">reforestation
                        projects</a>.
                </p>


                <h4>How can you collaborate?</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>By reading second hand books you are reducing the number of trees that are cut to create new
                        books.
                    </li>

                    <li>By paying us to rent a book instead of buying a brand new book you are contributing to
                        reforest the
                        planet.</li>

                    <li>You can also <a href="{% url 'donate' %}">donate</a> your second hand books to help us
                        growing the
                        collection and offer more choice to our members. (See our collection points)</li>

                    <li>Spread the word and help us get more members. More member reading our books means less trees
                        being
                        cut.</li>
